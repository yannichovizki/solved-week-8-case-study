The Scenario:After transitioning out of the military, you were contracted by a medium-sized start-up company that processes credit card transactions on a daily basis. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and other business staff have no knowledge of network security or the threats they face.

As the company’s subject matter expert/consultant, the CEO wants a 4-6 page report at the end of your assignment.
